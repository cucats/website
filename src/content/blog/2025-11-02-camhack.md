CamHack brought together 250+ people for a chaotic weekend of building. The participants ranged across disciplines: computer science, maths, natural sciences, engineering. People came together for 30 hours of fun and creativity.

The theme was "Unintended Behaviour." We wanted to step away from the usual hackathon focus on business value or pitching, and instead see what would happen if we prioritised absurdity over utility.

The projects were exactly that. Keyboard^2 turned a piano into a typewriter, mapping chord progressions to English letter frequencies. Doom scrolling took the concept literally, rendering the original DOOM using only loop TikToks in real-time.

We saw the Mis-Interpreter transpiling C code to run inside Minecraft and Mindustry and Compound Mapper which mapped the shape of molecules to read Albuquerque roads.

It was a reminder that the best projects often come from just messing around with friends.
