CamHack 2025 was a tremendous success which brought together 250+ people for a chaotic weekend of building! The participants ranged across disciplines: computer science, maths, natural sciences, engineering. People came together for 30 hours of fun and creativity.

The goal for each team was to build a project with the theme "**Unintended Behaviour**." We wanted to step away from the usual hackathon focus on business value or pitching, and instead see what would happen if we prioritised absurdity over utility. Fueled by enough pizza to feed a small army, the lab transformed into a playground for the weird and wonderful.

The projects were exactly that. **Keyboard^2** (the winner) turned a piano into a typewriter, mapping chord progressions to English letter frequencies because standard typing is just too easy. **Doom Scrolling** took the concept literally, rendering the original DOOM using only looping TikToks in real-time.

We saw **The Mis-Interpreter** forcing C code to run inside Minecraft and Mindustry, and **Compound Mapper** which mapped the shape of molecules to real Albuquerque roads so you could drive the shape of caffeine.

It was a reminder that the best projects often come from just messing around with friends.
