To welcome everyone to Cambridge, and start the year off right, CUCaTS stuck to a winning formula for our first social: bubble tea and board games. Because who doesn't like boba?

We wanted to strip away the formalities of networking and create a space where people could actually get to know each other.

We had 50 people packed into a room, with lots of conversation and a few intense games of Coup.

It was a chaotic, loud and incredibly fun start to the year. Thanks to everyone who joined us!
