To welcome everyone to Cambridge and kick off the year, we decided to stick to what we know and love: boba and board games. (I mean, who doesn't love boba?)

We really wanted to skip the awkward "networking" phase and just create a space where we could actually hang out. It was amazing to see 50 of you packed into the room, bringing the energy and getting surprisingly intense over games of Coup.

It was chaotic, loud, and the perfect start to the year. Thanks so much to everyone who came out!
