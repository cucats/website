        <p>
            At Hudson River Trading (HRT) we are mathematicians, computer scientists, statisticians,
            physicists and engineers. We research and develop automated trading algorithms using
            advanced mathematical techniques. We have built one of the world's most sophisticated
            compute environments, and our researchers are at the forefront of innovation in the
            world of algorithmic trading and machine learning.
        </p>
        <p>
            HRT was founded in 2002 by computer scientists and mathematicians who believed that math
            and technology could transform financial markets. They developed the algorithms that
            became the foundation for HRT's continued success across global asset classes. Today, we
            are global industry leaders, and a leading voice for fair and open markets. Our trading
            creates stronger markets for all investors, and all our work is built upon our rigorous
            code of ethics.
        </p>
        <p>
            We're a community of self-starters, critical thinkers, and eager problem-solvers.
            Collaboration is at the heart of our success — from an open-source code base to lively
            cross-team lunches in our cafe, a spirit of openness underscores everything we do. We
            celebrate great ideas from HRT veterans and new hires alike. We love solving the most
            complex problems in trading and technology, and believe the best work can only be done
            together.

            We're a startup that makes startups! We use AI to minimise the cost of building,
            operating and growing startups. Previously, we helped build Monzo. We're founded in
            March 2024 by former Monzo Co-Founder and CTO and backed by some of the world's best
            investors (Garry Tan, Naval Ravikant, Tom Blomfield, Accel, Index Ventures, OpenAI,
            founders of Anthropic, Perplexity, etc).
        </p>
        <p>
            In a few years' time, we believe that the majority of software will be made by people
            with no technical background, collaborating with an AI. What today takes weeks or months
            and a team of specialists will be accessible to everyone, take only minutes, and cost
            very little. Instead of one-size-fits-all products, everyone will be making their own
            tools, customized to their needs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Come spend 3 or 6 months with us to build and launch a revenue generating startup! You
            can build whatever you like. The only catch is that you have to use our AI generator to
            build your startup from human language input. And if it's not able to do so, you first
            need to improve the generator to make it generatable.
